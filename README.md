### What a stranger can do

You can:

* read the code
* ask questions if it's not clear
* advice if you believe how to do better
* make fun of it if you believe it's awful
* copy it

Please *do not*:

* be offended - not a single line in this repo is meant to offend you
* study based on this code - it might contain bad examples. It's done fast, not good.
* demand:
    * fixing a bug
    * continuing abandoned work
    * changing branch name, variable name, comment, etc...
    * following your advice
    * answering you question
